# C-How-to-Program
Hi, I'm Arthur, and I'm reading *C How To Program 8edition*  by Harvey Deitel and Paul Deitel. My goal is to deepen my knowledge of how computers and programming work.

I am using this repository to store my answers to the exercises from the book.
I read the book from the beginning and found a lot of interesting information, even in the basics.
However, this is not my first contact with the C language, so I started solving all the exercises from Chapter 6 onwards.

Another important observation: Because of the compiler im locally running, most of this code is not using the safer and proper functions as presented and recommended by the book from C11 Annex K.

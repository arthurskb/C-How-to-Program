# C-How-to-Program
Hi, I'm Arthur, and I'm reading *C How To Program 8edition*  by Harvey Deitel and Paul Deitel. My goal is to deepen my knowledge of how computers and programming work.

I am using this repository to store my answers to the exercises from the book.
I read the book from the beginning and found a lot of interesting information, even in the basics.
However, this is not my first contact with the C language, so I started solving all the exercises from Chapter 6 onwards.

Another important observation: I'm aware most of the code is insecure, nor well written or commented. I'm not following best practices to check inputs and boundaries, and because of the compiler im locally running, i'm not using the safer and proper functions as presented and recommended by the book from C11 Annex K.
